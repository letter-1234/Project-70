This event takes place for 1 hour after school everyday, after which the students can go home. This church is very quiet and peaceful when the students come. If they wish, they can also stay in the church after other people go, and during emergencies, students can go home early as well. However, praying in the church everyday brings very good ethics and principles to our students. Not only this, but we also say an oath each day to make our students acheive their goals and targets, and let them keep following the rules always.</p>

                        <p class="text-mmuted"> This library was made for the good of our school's students. There is a one hour library period for each class where the students come, relax and read various kinds of books peacefully. There are a lot of books the students can read, they can also issue maximum of 2 books for 1 whole week to read. Once they return it, they get to issue other books. We have recently created a new space inside the library, and have ordered some shelves in it. We have been ordering books as well, so that our students get to read maximum and various kinds of books. But our library is not only used for reading, if the students want, they can come here anytime when they don't have any classes in school or anytime after school to study or complete their homeworks. This creates a peaceful environment for our students to complete their pending tasks.</p>

This audi is used of annual days, project exhibhitions and for assemblies as well. There are more than 100 seats for the parents to sit comfortably. The sound system is also extremeley good and even the people sitting at the back can hear whatever is said. The auditorium is also used for practice before any particular event. There is a backstage here as well, where the students can prepare for their turns. Not only this, but the backstage also includes refreshments for the students in case of long events so that they don't get tired or exhausted. And there are refreshmentws for the parents and teachers as well!! The school auditorium has been used for various events since the past 15 years.</p>
